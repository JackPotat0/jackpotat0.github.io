- naming laphicet

loegres
- now eizen learns aifread is taken by melchior of abbey, so we have a common goal
- expedition
- man skits are just genius - organic way of world building and character exploration, this is definitely one of the core of tales series and what makes it special
- one of the best cutscene coming up
- trying to pass inspection
- act.like.a.dove
- to the castle - velvet triggered when hearing artorius name and tried to climb the castle
- artorius talks about Reason and will to do the right thing - he is actually the hero here, and we are the villains
- unlike the usual corrupt church trope the protags only have personal reasons to fight 
- checkout the shadow guild bloodwings and run errands
- night - lmao a bar has sake and whiskey at the same time - rokurou and eizen talks about velvets courage to take on abbey and their motives to band with velvet. they both want to know how can velvet do this. and they exchange sake and whiskey like bros
- magilou talks about finding a traitor
errands
- the town dont know anything about artorius prior to advent and cant tell he has ulterior motives

- assasinate high priest gideon for more info
- talk about the conspiracy - nectar to replace booze industry - actually quite creepy

villa
- library
- velvet takes a book for laphicet
- ambushed by eleanor, win but surrounded
- eleanor summons bienfu, caught by magilou, lol comedic relief, its not great here
- magilou give bienfu a name... i wonder theres a theme here
- magilou unlocked powers, fight continues
- i remember struggle in this fight 1st hard playthrough. moderate is so much easier, well knowing how to abuse the game helps too, doing it now in hard is easy too.
- eleanor lost, knocked out, gideon trying to justify selling literal drug for the abbey, then become daemon, strike out velvet
- gideon escaped, chasing and found a big bird daemon eating gideon, eleanor sees and learn daemon were people and abbey is keeping daemons...
- to go inside throne need 4 higher malaks,
- laphicet is begging magilou, everyone shocked, kid has agency now
to port zekson
- ok at this point velvet is repeating revenge like shes jack from stranger in paradise
- talk to laphicet at evening - eating apple (they rly want to express how eating is living), express fascination about the sea. velvet talks about laphi, laphicet decides to follow velvet
- found a related malak 
- we found eizen fighting with a guy, and cuz they want to fight so much we will just beat them together so they listen lol
- he helped to break the barrier, drops name zaveid, and leaves
- the temple is built on where earthpulse is strong
- eleanor meets artorius in hall to report incident in loegres, he responded she was overcome by emotions, she questions about daemon at villa, bird question to eleanor, her answer: same answer. that knowledge is not for you. he knows velvet is coming and admits theres is a tie to be severed.
- this place is not very fun 
- reach the top, discuss battle strategy, velvet will charge and use laphicet to heal. she ordered laphicet after all the talk  about choice.
- we all know this is far from over, but for them this is it. theres a dissonance here. probably cant solve this.
- utter defeat, he summons innominat, and the antagonist party comes up, confirming relationship with shigure and aifread
- laphicet seeing velvet getting destroyed starts crying, she regrets she cant do anything for laphi, eleanor has some epxression, teresa tries to take control of laphicet but he fights back
- suddenly a portal appears and everyone with eleanor goes in
another world
- velvet dream 3 - dream of celica but it is seres
- wakes up and find laphicet coma, she carries him and move. actually quite cool
- eizen appears, they are sealed in earthpulse, its like a river flowing with natures life energy aka lifestream
- innominat and laphicet power collided it become unstable, laphicet at risk to become demon unless theres a vessel for him
- eleanor shows up and volunteers. velvet is not very happy. she convince her. eleanor feels intense power
- rokurou and magilou are in another part. she bet 10 gald velvet gives up lul.
- eizen and velvet appears and regroup
yvolg ruins
- theres a symbol here. this is temple of empyrean of earth eumacia. ancient ppl build temples closer to earthpulse
- outside the ruin, found eleanor, if velvet wins, she will follow her orders, else die. now velvet is willing to take control of others for her will.
- eleanor dropped her guard, and tries to seppuku but laphicet inside stop her
- then she faints
- talk to laphicet
- velvet thanks laphicet and apologize for using as tool, laphicet emphasise again thats his choice. sweet moment
- magilou comes up and bet she will break for 100 gald, just tagging along
- rpg time: the book from villa has innominat symbol, and magilou knows a friend to decipher
- eleanor awakens as everyones asleep
- she feels disgraced and wants to suicide but artorius talks through earthpulse, give her mission to take laphicet back to abbey
- eizen and velvet see everything
morning
- eleanor dont know a whole lot about how innominat and eliminate daemons
- oaths has a lot more meaning in this world than the usual or the deal with velvet
- appearance of women: damn funny skit, laphicet is immediately applying what he learnt
- we meet a guy, he tells us about this place, a daemon called sword breaker and 
- we fight swordbreaker
- rokurou wants to solo it, laphicet helps and he got angry, girls protect laphicet
- eleanor says she protected laphicet cuz order, but its her will too
- lore on swordbreaker - a swordsmith called kurogane who wants to best rokurou family god blade aka stormhowl with stormquell
tunnel
- velvet continue to ask laphicet to distrust eleanor - this will go on for some time
- found shigure beating up kurogane, guy has a talking cat malak, and rokurou fight him solo(tho hes easy cuz he has to be)
- ofc lose and shigure runs away and he will wait at port for another fight
- this place is miserable
- rokurou is bitterly determined to beat shigure, it is a form of grudge and some sort of "retribution" which now i see how it still "fits" the overall theme
- kurogane will forge rokurou a new blade with his own head
- rokurous blade is imitation stormhowl
- actually eizen and velvet agrees on a lot of things being the calculating person. its a nice thing to have while the others are pretty random
- eleanor didnt believe artorius sacrificed laphi
- we stop some exorcists trying to eliminate elearnor for treason in the tunnel
- eleanor tries to explain but have to fight but still cant bring herself to kill em
- rokurou appears and clean the fight
- velvet now allow eleanor to not kill exorcist
- now velvet knows she is determined to not kill
port cadnix
- empty as expected
- face off with sbigure
- rangetsu theme is pretty good
- well ofc lose again, better luck next time
- heading to yseult to find grimoire
- eleanor skit - overly serious personality but cute, velvet is actually really considerate... this is how velvet is crafted between edgelord and actual girl, its great stuff
to yseult
- learn a bit about aifread, your typical pirate captain
- to port reneed cuz corsairs scourge - not like scurvy, it looks like its infectious
reneed
- need to find a herb in the wilds - this is typical jrpg stuff, tales wraps it well with good characters and engaging plot, dq just does not.
- eizen being smartass is funny
- news about high priest and the event in capital spreads fast
warg forest
- magilou says sale tomah flower is ugly, a tease on flower usually being beautiful in jrpgs
- apparently eleanor is also a smartass at times
- sale tomah is deceitful coexistence, however the team thinks they have commonalites
- something suggest this daemon is not normal
- the daemon is also guarded by abbey
- laphicet wants to keep the bug, others agreed to keep for observation
- yes of course dumb banters about beetles and other random stuff, i love it
- exorcist can absorb nutrients from tethered malak... hmm
back from forest
- hi zaveid, summoning persona but not, eizen riled up and leaves,
port
- crew is not happy with leaving eizen, but they are going for him anyways, melchior is related
- eleanor eating flower, poor girl
- magilou is fed with flower after, lol
burnack plateau
- to lothringen, abbey training base
- meet fainted exorcist, presumably taken down by zaveid, 
- eizen talks about how aifread accepted and inspired him to join the crew despite his curse
- exorcist ranks - decided by innate mana affinity, but according to eleanor all joins for noble cause, which is doubted. the games didnt really explore the inner workings of abbey apart from this. 
lothringen
- eleanor ask about disappearance of aifread, but only to learn melchior is sus, it is apparent that shes starting to doubt her own alliance
- eizen sees through fake aifread, but stunned by a illusion girl
- zaveids gun can restore consciousness to malaks
- melchior turns the malaks to daemons with dark rasengan
- zaveid stops velvet from devouring the last wyvern cuz kill bad
- the gun is called siegfried (ironic) and melchior clones it and leaves
- lost melchior. magilou explains melchior can analyse artes
- zaveid used to be controlled by abbey, aifread restore his mind, but melchior captured him later and aifread gave the gun before captured.
- aifread is pretty dead by now
- cant work with zaveid cuz he dont kill
- girl with umbrella - one of the funniest skits - the girls be girls
back to reneed
- boy called videl, shares interest in history with laphicet
- hide the gang in his house when abbey inspection
- omega elixir quest
- interesting residents mentioned how just the existence of unknown daemons will disrupt their daily lifes, a small but good detail for worldbuilding
to yseult
- eleanors reflection - somethings not right, rokurou interrupts, eleanor shares her village is destroyed by daemons also, and swears to destroy daemons (eren moment)
yseult
- somehow laphicet can tell magilou is awkward, she says her feelings broke
- saw teresa and oscar, oscar is assigned to palamedes
- focus on this brother sister bond
- magilou is sus of eleanor cuz good timing but cant prove it
- laphicet vouch and eizen calls of a infighting between eleanor and velvet
- this area used to worship amenoch the water empyrean until abbey steps in, only haria keep their faith
- funny how velvet is concerned with laphicets preferences
- here is where velvet and eleanor start fighting over laphicet, 
- man this game has way too many worldbuilding tidbits its hard to cover it all
maclir beach
- grimoirh is there
- fight the lizard
- grim is not very interested, not even velvet threats work
- laphicet wants to learn to read himself, more agency moments, and grim gives in
haria
- deciphering ancient text - how convenient to just say text need guesswork to avoid getting into the details... but this is minor plot detail and not crucial to overall worldbuilding
- "Eight-headed is the Lord of the Land, with seven mouths to devour malevolence. Through pulses of earth doth face nature's flow, as He awaits the time of awakening."
"Four Empyreans may tear Him asunder, but so long as there is one receptive to divine power, therions shall be forever reborn in sight of the full crimson moon."
"The Namelesss Empyrean hath one heart. The Nameless Empyrean hath one body."
- they figured they need to kill the therions 
- this may be a spoiler if you manage to intepret in a different way...
- asked to find the priestess and her daughter
to temple
- eleanor is also curious about the truth behind abbeys plan. her writing is consistent. staying true to herself not for the sake of abbey or anything. abbey is just her current way to help the world
- laphicet and bienfu talks about velvet and eleanor, different side of the same coin
- magilou casually commits sexual harassment on child
- im so done with this games walking
palamedes temple
- daemons inside, dead exorcists
- eizen is humble when he is wrong about history
- priestess already become daemon, eleanor is especially startled, daemon escapes
-

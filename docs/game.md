## Video Games Collection

I only got in touch with video games in my late teens so I didn't get to play too much of them. Moreover life is getting in my way slowly but surely.

### **ALL TIME favourites**
*The games that changed my gaming view (ruin other games) in one way or another. Feel free to debate with me on these games.*

#### **Kingdom Hearts 2 Final Mix (PS2)**
This game serves as my first experience to speedrunning. I found [Bl00dyBizkit's AGDQ2017 run](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVjf3bc3Noo&t=4588s) when looking for Roxas strats and the rest is history, and this is still my favourite speedrun. I play the randomizer a lot and learnt some speedrun strats.

#### **Persona 4 (PS2/Golden PC)**
My first Persona game. This game captures the feeling of living a (not so) simple student life in a small town and just hanging out with friends. The cast is very endearing and full of personality. Immediately started NG+ right after NG, almost 100% except fighting Margaret, learnt speedrun routes for P4G.

#### **Final Fantasy X (PC)** 
My first Final Fantasy game. Absolutely love the characters, the world and the plot. It is an epic yet emotional journey and in the end you are really convinced that *This IS Tidus's story*. The first game that made me almost cried real tears. But I suck at this game, can't even finish a guided run. And yes the OST is definitely not the greatest FF OST despite having two of the best motifs in the series.

#### **The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker (GC)** 
My first Zelda game. The game aged like fine wine. It is overflowing with charm with its cutesy and colourful designs. The perfect introductory Zelda IMO. I also invested quite a lot of time in the randomizer to become semi proficient.

#### **Tales of Berseria** 
The plot is refreshing and engaging and heavily theme driven. Almost every main character ties heavily into the main plot from the beginning to the end and brings out the theme in various different angles. The story execution and the ending is next to perfect. The cast also has strong personality and have fantastic interaction with each other. Completed most sidequests and I am normally a no-sidequest player. The things that drags it down are the bad dungeons(literal hallways) and less memorable OST.

#### **Bug Fables: The Everlasting Sapling**
A simple story does not mean that it is not meaningful or bad. The main cast only consists of 3 characters and the story is their adventure to obtain a treasure. But this gives substantial development and attachment for all 3 of them. Their conversation feels like real people are role playing the characters and NPCs. Paper Mario style gameplay is great, giving an easy way to wreck the game is great for turn based noob like me. The OST is definitely inspired from Mario and similiar genres, a composer that should be watched with great interest.

#### **Trails in the Sky FC+SC** (I consider as one story split into two games) 
- Elaborate world building
- Great cast chemistry. Not just Estelle between others, but other party members among each other too. Makes you forget they are really not that unique out of their archetypes.
- Natural character growth. You spent about 80 hours with Estelle and seeing her growing from a naive girl to a matured and competent Bracer is simply inspiring.
- Banger OST. From jazz to rock to emotional harmonicas. Take your pick. 
- Good combat system, though a bit easy to exploit
- Maybe the best localization ever existed in video games. Truly the soul of this game. The game is carried largely by this. They turned anime cliche dialogue into magic. Everyone's lines are witty and to the point.
- **Estelle is Bestelle**

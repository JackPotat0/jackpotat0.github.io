## Video Games Collection

I only got in touch with video games in my late teens so I didn't get to play too much of them. Moreover life is getting in my way slowly but surely.
** Scores are ranked based on personal preferences

### **ALL TIME favourites**
*The games that changed my gaming view (ruin other games) in one way or another. Feel free to debate with me on these games.*

#### **Kingdom Hearts 2 Final Mix (PS2)**
This game serves as my first experience to speedrunning. I found [Bl00dyBizkit's AGDQ2017 run](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVjf3bc3Noo&t=4588s) when looking for Roxas strats and the rest is history. This is still my favourite speedrun of all time. I play the randomizer a lot and learnt some speedrun strats. Everything about combat in this game (aside from some questionable boss designs) is just perfect.

| C | D | S+ | S | Roxas |

Best tracks: Darkness of the Unknown, Dearly Beloved, The Other Promise

#### **Persona 4 (PS2/Golden PC)**
My first Persona game. This game captures the feeling of living a (not so) simple student life in a small town and just hanging out with friends. The cast is very endearing and full of personality. Immediately started NG+ right after NG, almost 100% except fighting Margaret, learnt speedrun routes for P4G.

Best tracks: I'll Face Myself (Battle Version), Heartbeat Heartbreak, Snowflakes

#### **Final Fantasy X (PC)** 
My first Final Fantasy game. Absolutely love the characters, the world and the plot. It is an epic yet emotional journey and in the end you are really convinced that this IS Tidus's story. The first video game ending that made me almost cried real tears. But I suck at this game, can't even finish a guided speedrun. And yes the OST is definitely not the greatest FF OST despite having two of the best motifs in the series. Any and all FFX sequels do not exist.

Best tracks: To Zanarkand, Suteki da ne, Assault

#### **The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker (GC)** 
My first Zelda game. The game aged like fine wine. It is overflowing with charm with its cutesy and colourful designs. The perfect introductory Zelda IMO. I also invested quite a lot of time in the randomizer to become semi proficient.

Best tracks: Dragon Roost Island, Great Sea, Molgera

#### **Tales of Berseria (PC)** 
The plot is refreshing and engaging and heavily theme/character driven. Almost every main character ties heavily into the main plot from the beginning to the end and brings out the theme in various different angles. The story execution and the ending is next to perfect. My eyes are definitely sweating during the sequence. The cast also has strong personality and have fantastic interaction with each other. Completed most sidequests and I am normally a no-sidequest player. The things that drags it down are the bad dungeons(literal hallways) and less memorable OST.

| S+ | S+ | D | A- | Velvet/Eleanor |

Best tracks: Shout Your Soul, True Will, Eleanor's Theme


#### **Bug Fables: The Everlasting Sapling (PC)**
A simple story does not mean that it is not meaningful or bad. The main cast only consists of three characters and the story is their adventure to obtain a treasure. But this gives substantial development and attachment for all three of them. Their conversation feels like real people are role playing the characters and NPCs. Paper Mario style gameplay is great, giving an easy way to wreck the game is great for turn based noob like me (All hail Weak Stomach). The OST is definitely inspired from Mario and similiar genres, a composer that should be watched with great interest. Done some runs before.

Best tracks: Team, This One's Stronger!, FIGHT!, Team, It's Getting Serious!

#### **Trails in the Sky FC+SC (PSP)** (I consider as one story split into two games) 
- Elaborate world building
- Great cast chemistry. Not just Estelle between others, but other party members among each other too. Makes you forget they are really not that unique within their archetypes.
- Natural character growth. You spent about 80 hours with Estelle and seeing her growing from a naive girl to a matured and competent Bracer is simply inspiring.
- Banger OST. From jazz to rock to emotional harmonicas. Take your pick. 
- Good combat system, though a bit easy to exploit
- Maybe the best localization ever existed in video games. Truly the soul of this game. The game is carried largely by this. They turned anime cliche dialogue into magic. Everyone's lines are witty and to the point.
- The ending for both games are just perfect. Every single detail.
- **Estelle is Bestelle**

Best tracks: Confessions, Sophiscated Fight, Whereabouts of Stars, The Fate of the Fairies, Whereabouts of Hope, Shine of Aidios

#### **Final Fantasy IX (PS1)**
I am struggling to decide whether to put this here or the next category. I had been blinded by the internet that this is not for me, and boy is that WRONG. This could easily be my favourite FF if I had played this before FFX (though FFX is still the better introductory FF imo). This is a really solid game without a lot to complain.

It is interesting to see how the storytelling in the series evolved throughout FFVII to FFX. It fixed most issues in FFVIII story wise and set a great groundwork for FFX. Garnet/Dagger is written wonderfully and acts like a real 16 year old girl under the circumstances. Zidane is a refreshing protagonist as he is a largely developed character at the beginning and has a nice arc wrapping up his character near the end. The other characters also stayed as relevant for as long as possible (maybe not Amarant, he is definitely the weakest in the narative). **Vivi is precious and must be protected.** The theme of life and its purpose is quite timeless and thought provoking.

I liked how everyone has a fixed role that cannot be changed. Getting new equipments is exciting with the weapon ability system. The slow load times and long animations are real but can be easily solved with emulator speedups (and I believe the battle theme is synced to the long battle loads). The world map is easy to navigate and the encounter rate is really acceptable. Quina is the first blue mage I used extensively (7=I don't like Cait Sith, 8=I don't do encounters after getting No-Enc from Diablos, 10=Kimahri and blue magic is just useless most of the time.). The only complaint about it is the Trance system with too much randomness.

Soundrack wise I still prefer FFVII and FFVIII's OST slightly but still a win over FFX OST overall. And I like some dungeon music (Mount Gulug), which is a rare case for me. Melodies of Life is also a great motif and used with a lot of care.

### **REALLY good**
*I would highly suggest you to give these a try.*

#### Ys: Oath in Felghana
Makes you wonder if you are playing a bullet hell or an ARPG

| B | B | A | A |  |

Best tracks: Chop!, The Boy who had Wings, Valenstein Castle

#### Ys Origin
Similiar to Ys:OiF, but you get to play with three characters on the same map, it can get repetitive but overall a major upgrade from it.

#### Persona 3 FES (PS2) / Persona 3 Portable (PSP)
A very theme driven game and successfully brings out the message of facing death and living in a compelling way. The OST though good is not my style. There are some glaring issues like imbalanced pacing, tedious dungeon climbing and questionable social links but still makes for a great experience. The four movies can be an acceptable way to experience the main plot as that is what makes this game shine.

Best tracks: Memories of You, Memories of the City, Sun

#### Kingdom Hearts 1 (PS2)
A simple Hero's Journey, but a great one. Unlike the later KH games, the main plot is tied nicely with the Disney worlds, making Sora's journey necessary and important to his character. One of the best execution for "Friendship is Power" trope. It can be cheesy but it is good because it is not baseless. Combat is simple and effective but the camera... did not age too well.

Best tracks: Dearly Beloved, Night of Fate, Traverse Town

#### The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess (GC)
Actually a better Zelda game than WW in terms of complexity and combat. Midna is a great character and added a lot to the simple plot. Wolf Link is cool and TP Link is my favourite Link in the series.

#### The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask (N64)
This game gets full marks in atmosphere and world crafting. Not a fan of non linear gameplay (had to follow a guide to clear it) but I appreciate it exists.

More like an interactive visual novel. An emotional story with a thick plot behind.

#### Finding Paradise (PC)
Sequel to *To the Moon*. I prefer TtM's story over this but still equally good. The plot thickens ~~which is definitely not a sequel bait~~

#### Tales of Symphonia (PC)
The textbook RPG grand adventure. It contains every trope you have known and expect, yet manages to present itself with all the advantages of the tropes and stand out among others. I thought the plot twist although expected but still as shocking. The weak points being the combat and half of the cast not being relevant after their arcs.

It is a classic alright. Definitely prefer this over MM for linearity.

#### Chrono Trigger (SNES)
The game that 100% deserves its reputation of all time JRPG classic. Many elements that are ahead of the time like non random encounters and character based sidequests. Highly polished and rich in content for the time. Jets of Time randomizer is sick.

#### Ori and the Blind Forest (PC)
very good game but metroidvania is not my type. Also not a fan of western atmospheric OSTs, all thanks to Yoko Shimomura the Leitmotif Queen, influencing my music taste forever.

#### Tales of the Abyss (PS2)
Great story, props to the scriptwriter for having the balls to write this kind of story. Luke's development is arguably one of the best in all of JRPGs. The other cast goes from decent to great (Anise can kindly fk off tho). The combat is a direct upgrade from Symphonia and is so so much better with the addition of Free Run. I loved the FoF mechanic. The pacing can be odd, way too many back and forth in between world maps. Guy is in the top 10 dudebros in JRPG history and no one can change my mind. Sadly its OST is all time low, only some important battle themes stand out, and the rest sounding too much like Symphonia or simply forgettable. Shoutouts to the anime, it is a fantastic adaptation and you should watch it.

Best tracks: The Arrow Was Shot, Karma, Meaning of Life


#### Final Fantasy VII (PS1)
Decent story and characters. Having an event driven plot makes the characters feel a bit lacking. And the translation is indeed trash as it is almost impossible to understand the main plot correctly without explanations online. I highly recommend to emulate if you can accept the LEGO block models.

#### Terranigma (SNES)
Truly an ARPG ahead of its time. Great OST to create the mysterious and sombre atmosphere. Slightly dark/bittersweet ending is a nice touch. Surprisingly having some decent cast. Ark is simply a better Crono from Chrono Trigger.

#### Trails in the Sky the 3rd (PC)
A spin off ish game but not. Nice to see some detailed character back story and future moves. Serviceable main plot compared to FC+SC. Kevin and Ries are great and all but didn't really hit as hard.

#### Odin Sphere (PS2) 
A decent fairy tale with a somewhat elaborate world with a grander plot, multiple characters, everyone have arcs ranging from amazing to OK, decent OST. Combat can be clunky and alchemy can be a bit confusing. Also challenges resource management quite a bit due to very limited inventory. It features JP and English dub too, which is most rare in PS2 games.

Best tracks: Battle in the Witch Forest 2, Attic Archive, Hope Followed by a Difficult Battle

#### Okami HD (PC) 
The Zelda game that is not named Zelda, feels a lot like Twilight Princess overall (wolf with a small sidekick and cleansing the world part). Running and jumping around as a cool wolf is fun. Beautiful Japanese artstyle. Brush gameplay is cool. Sadly the combat is just about the same as TP - too many tools made the fights too easy. The puzzles are really quite easy but can stuck in some places similar to Wind Waker, some parkours are pretty challenging IMO. The story is the simple save the world plot, but a lot goofier than I imagined. They really should have kept everything in one act instead of having multiple acts that shreds the hype. Boss reuse is pretty bad, not adding anything new even. Music is purely atmospheric. Derpy Ammy is pretty great.

### **INTERESTING titles**
*May not appeal to a lot of people, but still worth to check out*

#### Final Fantasy VIII (PC)
Plot: Mess, Characters (esp Squall and Rinoa): Beautiful, Gameplay: Mess, Music: Beautiful. Rated beautiful mess. Basically only Squall and Rinoa are the stars of this game. The important bits of other characters are either hidden in side quests or simply non existent. Seifer is such a wasted opportunity as a great rival to Squall. They could have done so much better with the story. Great OST, good use of motifs without making it repetitive like FFX. The gameplay... just nope. I used boosters in this game and did not regret a single bit.

#### Persona 2: Innocent Sin (PSP) 
Weird game. I am so glad PSP version is that easy i never fused a single persona (read: never engaged with battle system). Story is fine but sure can get weird very fast. Sadly I didn't like the music as much as I wanted to. Liked how no one is crafted as waifu/husbando or into specific tropes and equally reveals their lovable and hatable points.

#### Child of Light (PC)
It is waaaay too short for the price, could have use another dungeon or two, Casual is a bit too easy but who would expect normal RPG gamer mode to be named Expert. Nice combat system though can feel slow every battle. Nice little fairy tale but far weaker than Odin Sphere, half decent cast that has short stories tied into their quest but did not have any meaningful development in any way.

### **PRETTY nice but skippable**
*Don't waste money or time on these unless you can afford to. Not very memorable in any way.*

#### Tokyo Xanadu Ex+ (PC)
I will always use this phrase to describe this game: *Budget Persona 4 - Made with Lots of Love*. Seeing what Falcom had achieved with Trails in the Sky I am even more confused why is this so mid. It contains every anime trope but does nothing interesting for the entire game. Some characters even looks like they are directly adapted from Persona 3/4. The main plot could have been fine but the True Ending had to ruin it. Somehow it managed to create another Kairi from KH, as if Kairi is not bad enough (no hate for Kairi here, she's pretty cute but nothing more than that). Combat is quite shallow and simple but is the best part about it, most mechanics are just "I Win Buttons", at least there is dodge roll. Bosses ranges between too easy or too annoying.

Meh Persona fanfic. All the characters you love become one dimensional and are used for "comedy" purpose. Has a decent original plot though. Etrian Odyssey gameplay is cool. Way too easy to exploit once you know it (Poison/Light+Dark skills).

### **EH**
*Would suggest to avert your eyes from and skip these*

#### Kingdom Hearts 358/2 Days (DS) 
Played this for the story only cuz Roxas is my boy, Xion is eh. Definitely nailed the mundane life, if that is what the devs intended. Actually has a coherent story within which is the only good thing. Combat has some potential but largely wasted, definitely can be remade.

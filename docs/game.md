## Video Games Collection

I only got in touch with video games in my late teens so I didn't get to play too much of them. Moreover life is getting in my way slowly but surely.
** Scores are ranked based on personal preference

### **ALL TIME favourites**
*The games that changed my gaming view (ruin other games) in one way or another. Feel free to debate with me on these games.*

#### **Kingdom Hearts 2 Final Mix (PS2)**
This game serves as my first experience to speedrunning. I found [Bl00dyBizkit's AGDQ2017 run](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVjf3bc3Noo&t=4588s) when looking for Roxas strats and the rest is history, and this is still my favourite speedrun. I play the randomizer a lot and learnt some speedrun strats. Everything about combat in this game (aside from some questionable boss designs) is just perfect.

#### **Persona 4 (PS2/Golden PC)**
My first Persona game. This game captures the feeling of living a (not so) simple student life in a small town and just hanging out with friends. The cast is very endearing and full of personality. Immediately started NG+ right after NG, almost 100% except fighting Margaret, learnt speedrun routes for P4G.

#### **Final Fantasy X (PC)** 
My first Final Fantasy game. Absolutely love the characters, the world and the plot. It is an epic yet emotional journey and in the end you are really convinced that *This IS Tidus's story*. The first game that made me almost cried real tears. But I suck at this game, can't even finish a guided run. And yes the OST is definitely not the greatest FF OST despite having two of the best motifs in the series.

#### **The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker (GC)** 
My first Zelda game. The game aged like fine wine. It is overflowing with charm with its cutesy and colourful designs. The perfect introductory Zelda IMO. I also invested quite a lot of time in the randomizer to become semi proficient.

#### **Tales of Berseria (PC)** 
The plot is refreshing and engaging and heavily theme driven. Almost every main character ties heavily into the main plot from the beginning to the end and brings out the theme in various different angles. The story execution and the ending is next to perfect. The cast also has strong personality and have fantastic interaction with each other. Completed most sidequests and I am normally a no-sidequest player. The things that drags it down are the bad dungeons(literal hallways) and less memorable OST.

#### **Bug Fables: The Everlasting Sapling (PC)**
A simple story does not mean that it is not meaningful or bad. The main cast only consists of three characters and the story is their adventure to obtain a treasure. But this gives substantial development and attachment for all three of them. Their conversation feels like real people are role playing the characters and NPCs. Paper Mario style gameplay is great, giving an easy way to wreck the game is great for turn based noob like me. The OST is definitely inspired from Mario and similiar genres, a composer that should be watched with great interest.

#### **Trails in the Sky FC+SC (PSP)** (I consider as one story split into two games) 
- Elaborate world building
- Great cast chemistry. Not just Estelle between others, but other party members among each other too. Makes you forget they are really not that unique outside their archetypes.
- Natural character growth. You spent about 80 hours with Estelle and seeing her growing from a naive girl to a matured and competent Bracer is simply inspiring.
- Banger OST. From jazz to rock to emotional harmonicas. Take your pick. 
- Good combat system, though a bit easy to exploit
- Maybe the best localization ever existed in video games. Truly the soul of this game. The game is carried largely by this. They turned anime cliche dialogue into magic. Everyone's lines are witty and to the point.
- **Estelle is Bestelle**

### **REALLY good**
*I would highly suggest you to give these a try.*

#### Ys: Oath in Felghana
Makes you wonder if you are playing bullet hell or an ARPG

#### Ys Origin
Similiar to Ys:OiF, but you get to play with three characters on the same map, it can get repetitive but overall a major upgrade from it.

#### Persona 3 FES (PS2) / Persona 3 Portable (PSP)
A very theme driven game and successfully brings out the message of facing death and living in a compelling way. The OST though good is not my style. There are some glaring issues like imbalanced pacing, tedious dungeon climbing and questionable social links but still makes for a great experience. The four movies can be an acceptable way to experience the main plot as that is what makes this game shine.

#### Kingdom Hearts 1 (PS2)
A simple Hero's Journey, but a great one. Unlike the later KH games, the main plot is tied nicely with the Disney worlds, making Sora's journey necessary and important to his character. One of the best execution for "Friendship is Power" trope. It can be cheesy but it is good because it is not baseless. Combat is simple and effective but the camera... did not age too well.

#### The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess (GC)
Actually a better Zelda game than WW in terms of complexity and combat. Midna is a great character and added a lot to the simple plot. Wolf Link is cool and my favourite Link in the series.

#### The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask (N64)
This game gets full marks in atmosphere and world crafting. Not a fan of non linear gameplay (had to follow the guide to clear it) but I appreciate it exists.

#### To the Moon (PC)
More like an interactive visual novel. An emotional story with a thick plot behind.

#### Finding Paradise (PC)
Sequel to *To the Moon*. I prefer TtM's story over this but still equally good. The plot thickens ~~which is definitely not a sequel bait~~

#### Tales of Symphonia (PC)
The textbook RPG grand adventure. It contains every trope you have known and expect, yet manages to present itself with all the advantages of the tropes and stand out among others. I thought the plot twist although expected but still as shocking. The weak points being the combat and half of the cast not being relevant after their arcs.

#### The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time (N64)
It is a classic alright. Definitely prefer this over MM for linearity.

#### Chrono Trigger (SNES)
The game that 100% its reputation of all time JRPG classic. Many elements that are ahead of the time like non random encounters and character based sidequests. Highly polished and rich in content for the time. Jets of Time randomizer is sick.

#### Ori and the Blind Forest (PC)
very good game but metroidvania is not my type. Also not a fan of western atmospheric OSTs, all thanks to Yoko Shimomura the Leitmotif Queen, influencing my music taste forever.

#### Tales of the Abyss (PS2)
Great story, props to the scriptwriter for having the balls to write this kind of story. Luke's development is arguably one of the best in all of JRPGs. The other cast goes from decent to great(Anise can kindly fk off tho). The combat is a direct upgrade from Symphonia and is so so much better with the addition of Free Run. I loved the FoF mechanic. The pacing can be odd, way too many back and forth in between world maps. Guy is in the top 10 dudebros in JRPG history and no one can change my mind. Sadly its OST is all time low, only some important battle themes stand out, and the rest sounding too much like Symphonia or simply forgettable.

#### Final Fantasy VII (PS1)
Decent story and characters. Probably my favourite FF combat system so far. Having an event driven plot makes the characters feel a bit lacking. And the translation is indeed trash as it is almost impossible to understand the main plot correctly without explanations online.

#### Terranigma (SNES)
Truly an ARPG ahead of its time. Great OST to create the mysterious and sombre atmosphere. Slightly dark/bittersweet ending is a nice touch. Surprisingly having some decent cast. Ark is simply a better Crono from Chrono Trigger.

#### Trails in the Sky the 3rd (PC)
Spin off ish. Nice to see some detailed character back story and future moves. Serviceable main plot compared to FC+SC. Kevin and Ries are great and all but didn't really hit as hard.

## Video Games Collection

I only got in touch with video games in my late teens so I didn't get to play too much of them. Moreover life is getting in my way slowly but surely.
** Scores are ranked based on personal preferences

### **ALL TIME favourites**
*The games that changed my gaming view (ruin other games) in one way or another. Feel free to debate with me on these games. Just go play these already!!*

#### **Kingdom Hearts 2 Final Mix (PS2)**
This game serves as my first experience to speedrunning. I found [Bl00dyBizkit's AGDQ2017 run](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVjf3bc3Noo&t=4588s) when looking for Roxas strats and the rest is history. This is still my favourite speedrun of all time. I play the randomizer a lot and learnt some speedrun strats. Everything about combat in this game (aside from some questionable boss designs) is just perfect. 

Story/Plot: The prologue is amazing. In just a few hours you are connected to one of the best written character in the series, then it's all downhill from there. Disney worlds are meh, didnt really teach Sora anything personally. Nobody lore is alright. Organization XIII works just enough for evil corporation but nothing memorable. The ending execution is pretty good though. ~~They could have ended KH right there~~. The only three story beats in the game I cared are the prologue, battle with Roxas and the ending. 

Characters: A huge mess. Sora loses the spunkiness in KH1 and just a good guy now. Kairi remains useless even when awake. Roxas is the only great character in this game. The way he faces his fate and coming to terms is pretty heart wrenching. Riku is actually OK, but his arc kind of ended in 358/2 Days. Axel is pretty fine but also more elaborated in Days. It is rather hard to connect with the new casts, villains or not. 

Gameplay: Hands down the greatest ARPG combat system of all time in my heart. Combos are fluid and snappy. Camera is great. There are a ton of different mechanics that you can mix and match. Great difficulty settings. Fantastic bosses like Lingering Will and Sephiroth... and I can still go on. I doubt there will ever be another action game that feels better than this game.

Music: One of Yoko Shimomura's magnum opus. Other than Disney world related track that I don't enjoy as much, the rest of the soundtrack is pretty much perfect. It also has one of the best Dearly Beloved. Sound engineering is great too, the use of silence is especially remarkable.

Best tracks: Darkness of the Unknown, Dearly Beloved, The Other Promise

#### **Persona 4 (PS2/Golden PC)**
My first Persona game. Immediately started NG+ right after NG, almost 100% except fighting Margaret, learnt speedrun routes for P4G.

Story/Plot: The main plot itself is actually just fine. It manages to convey its theme but nothing groundbreaking. It excels at character centric arcs which takes up most of the game. This game captures the feeling of living a (not so) simple student life in a small town and just hanging out with friends. The Golden addition is nice just for more team bonding moments but the new plotline is really forgettable and adds nothing to the already complete story. 

Characters: My favourite Persona cast. The cast is very endearing and full of personality. The team may be cliched but never one dimensional, although much are hidden in their social links, some of the SLs are still and will be the top SLs in the series (Kanji, Naoto, Yosuke). The other NPC social links are generally decent, but not a lot of them stand out amongst others (Good ones: Nanako, Dojima, Ai Ebihara, Kou, Death gandma, Naoki). Marie is just a bad character, the writers clearly have no clue how to write a tsundere yet tries to make it work. I just hate how she is shoehorned into the story and forced to be important just for no good reason. 

Gameplay: Standard SMT-lite gameplay. Dungeon crawling is a bit better than P3 but still a tedious experience overall. There are quite a few QoLs that just helps the overall experience.

Music: Really good. The 4 town themes just stuck with me ever since and probably will never leave my playlist, it just hits different when you are walking down the street in hot sunlight with *Your Affection* blasting in the headphones. Snowflakes sends chill down my spine when I first hear it. Nevermore is a decent motif. Just a really really solid soundtrack with J-Pop as the focus.

#### **Final Fantasy X (PC)** 
My first Final Fantasy game. Absolutely love the characters, the world and the plot. But I suck at this game, can't even finish a guided speedrun. 

Story/Plot: It is an epic yet emotional journey. In the end you are really convinced that this IS Tidus's story. The first video game ending that made me almost cried real tears. The romance is developed naturally and perfectly justified without being forceful. **Any and all FFX sequels do not exist.**

Characters: This game has one of the best cast in gaming history. Everyone is likeable and carry some flaws and changes throughout the journey naturally. Tidus is a great protagonist and easy for us to see the world through him.

Gameplay: Pretty slick turn based combat with more strategy planning than the reaction speed of ATB. I never engaged with it too much though. Sphere grid is still a unique progression system to handle linear and open job class even for today's standards. The minigames suck and the endgame is a grindfest that I never bothered with.

Music: The OST is definitely not the greatest FF OST despite having two of the best motifs in the series (To Zanarkand and Suteki Da Ne) - it is not as cohesive as the other previous titles due to having multiple composers. Most tracks sounds incredible in game but for some reason they sounded weaker out of it.

#### **The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker (GC)** 
My first Zelda game. The game aged like fine wine. It is overflowing with charm with its cutesy and colourful designs. The perfect introductory Zelda IMO. I also invested quite a lot of time in the randomizer to become semi proficient.

#### **Tales of Berseria (PC)** 
The plot is refreshing and engaging and heavily theme/character driven. Almost every main character ties heavily into the main plot from the beginning to the end and brings out the theme in various different angles. The story execution and the ending is next to perfect. My eyes are definitely sweating during the sequence. The cast also has strong personality and have fantastic interaction with each other. Completed most sidequests and I am normally a no-sidequest player. The things that drags it down are the bad dungeons(literal hallways) and less memorable OST.

Best tracks: Shout Your Soul, True Will, Eleanor's Theme


#### **Bug Fables: The Everlasting Sapling (PC)**
A simple story does not mean that it is not meaningful or bad. The main cast only consists of three characters and the story is their adventure to obtain a treasure. But this gives substantial development and attachment for all three of them. Their conversation feels like real people are role playing the characters and NPCs. Paper Mario style gameplay is great, giving an easy way to wreck the game is great for turn based noob like me (All hail Weak Stomach). The OST is definitely inspired from Mario and similiar genres, a composer that should be watched with great interest. Done some runs before.

#### **Trails in the Sky FC+SC (PSP)** (I consider as one story split into two games) 
- Elaborate world building
- Great cast chemistry. Not just Estelle between others, but other party members among each other too. Makes you forget they are really not that unique within their archetypes.
- Natural character growth. You spent about 80 hours with Estelle and seeing her growing from a naive girl to a matured and competent Bracer is simply inspiring.
- Banger OST. From jazz to rock to emotional harmonicas. Take your pick. 
- Good combat system, though a bit easy to exploit
- Maybe the best localization ever existed in video games. Truly the soul of this game. The game is carried largely by this. They turned anime cliche dialogue into magic. Everyone's lines are witty and to the point.
- The ending for both games are just perfect. EVERY SINGLE DETAIL.

Best tracks: Confessions, Sophiscated Fight, Whereabouts of Stars, The Fate of the Fairies, Whereabouts of Hope, Shine of Aidios

#### **Final Fantasy IX (PS1)**
I am struggling to decide whether to put this here or the next category. I had been blinded by the internet that this is not for me, and is that WRONG. This could easily be my favourite FF if I had played this before FFX (though FFX is still the better introductory FF imo). This is a really solid game without a lot to complain.

It is interesting to see how the storytelling in the series evolved throughout FFVII to FFX. It fixed most issues in FFVIII story wise and set a great groundwork for FFX. Garnet/Dagger is written wonderfully and acts like a real 16 year old girl under the circumstances. Zidane is a refreshing protagonist as he is a largely developed character at the beginning and has a nice arc wrapping up his character near the end. The other characters also stayed as relevant for as long as possible (maybe not Amarant, he is definitely the weakest in the narative, only act as a foil to Zidane's ideals). **Vivi is precious and must be protected.** The theme of life and its purpose is quite timeless and thought provoking.

I liked how everyone has a fixed role that cannot be changed. Getting new equipments is exciting with the weapon ability system. The slow load times and long animations are real but can be easily solved with emulator speedups (and I believe the battle theme is synced to the long battle loads). The world map is easy to navigate and the encounter rate is really acceptable. Quina is the first blue mage I used extensively (7=I don't like Cait Sith, 8=I don't do encounters after getting No-Enc from Diablos, 10=Kimahri and blue magic is just useless most of the time.). The only complaint about it is the Trance system with too much randomness (I didn't even see Eiko Trance once, at this point just remove it lol).

Soundtrack wise I still prefer FFVII and FFVIII's OST but still a slight win over FFX OST overall. And I like some dungeon music (Mount Gulug), which is a rare case for me. Melodies of Life is also a great motif and used with a lot of care.

#### **Ys VIII: Lacrimosa of Dana (PC)**
Ys series has come a long way.

Story/plot: The plot is to provide the setting mostly as one should expect from Ys games. Events on the island is nothing too noteworthy, just to lead up to finding Dana. But I still like how the survivors bonded under this extreme circumstance. To be fair, Dana's backstory is also quite simple but it is presented so masterfully I never thought I will see this in a Ys game. The way her mystery unfolds is captivating and the truth is satisfying to watch.
<details>
  <summary>Ending</summary>
  
  She literally Madoka'd herself. Script is 1:1 from PMMM last episode.
  
</details>

Characters: I enjoyed how they handled Adol - he is no longer a silent protagonist, just a very quiet dude. He does show a lot of personality throughout and it is great. The other cast other than Dana are just serviceable, works for the story and has some chemistry. Dana on the other hand is just fantastic. She is well established even we before we meet her. Her interactions with everyone is nice and just has a super positive energy that is down to earth. Design wise she has just the perfect balance of cute, cool and horny. Not the character with the most depth in the genre but definitely one of the best in the series. Why does she need to have blue hair and a name ending with -na... 

Gameplay: Full on action gameplay, Flash Guard and Move can be a bit too OP. Difficulty selection is great to serve everyone with different skill levels, one of the best entry points to ARPG probably. ARPG veterans need to set limits to properly enjoy the game. Island exploration is great fun. Bosses are mostly designed around the combat system, though there are some bosses that just break this rule, majority of them are well balanced. I mean like 70% of them, not including final boss and final final boss. If you're comfortable blocking/dodging here, you will do well in 80% of the ARPGs. 

Music: It's Falcom Sound Team jdk. One only expects the best from them and they did not disappoint here. They still maintain the metallic soul in Ys but blended with more modern sounds. I still cannot believe Iclucian Dance - the best field theme in the game is composed by Mitsuo Singa. Actually Singa did a phenomenal job here.

This is the first game I had officially completed to 100% !!

#### **Radiant Historia (DS)**
One of the best definitions of a solid game and well executed novel ideas put together. This game is going down into the history as one of the best DS games and JRPGs.

Story/plot: Warring nations is used as the backdrop for time travelling as many decisions will need to be made, it could not be more appropriate than this. It really feels like you are participating in a war personally especially in the beginning chapters. The design of choices and the responses are brilliant, most of the time both options make sense and are equally valid, but you never know if something unknown may influence the result down the line, encouraging players to make a choice without worrying too much. In the end it is still the same old save the world plot but does not really affect the experience. The pacing is tight and the writer is good at setting up and subverting expectations. The lore around time travelling is not that watertight at all so do not expect Steins;Gate out of this.

Characters: Stocke is a really well done protagonist. He presents himself like a standard JRPG protagonist but has enough quirks to make him different. The side cast are explored just enough like the main crew (Raynie, Marco, Rosch), still some are not that established (c'mon Gafka you can do better than this, even Raul has more character). I think this can be spared as backstory is not as important when a war is at hand. The dynamic is pretty good, giving the comrade feeling around the party. 

Gameplay: The best part of the game. The main gimmick revolves around travelling between two timelines to find solutions for the other timeline, requiring players to pay some attention to the main plot, though the hints sometimes are too obvious. No random encounters, suitably sized maps and field abilities make for a fun dungeon experience. The combat system is also a highlight. Each battle requires careful thought even if you have a good strategy (I heard there are lots of ways to break it but never found on my own, those are hidden in the sidequests).

Music: Ah yes it is Yoko Shimomura [insert fanboy screams here]. This is probably her shortest OST. Due to the game's structure, the music needs to be reusable enough in many cases and she nailed it as usual. You can hear a lot of KH style in it, with one track calling back to Legend of Mana (i think). Once a violin slut, always a violin slut.

### **REALLY good**
*I would highly suggest you to give these a try.*

#### Ys: Oath in Felghana (PC)
Makes you wonder if you are playing a bullet hell or an ARPG. Chester 2 fight gave the same feeling as Roxas in KH2, overwhelming, epic and the great feeling of finally defeating him.

Best tracks: Chop!, The Boy who had Wings, Valenstein Castle

#### Ys Origin (PC)
Similiar to Ys:OiF, but you get to play with three characters on the same map, it can get repetitive but overall a major upgrade from it. Some minor gripe is that you can cheese most fights with Yunica Phoenix once you get it, rendering melee moves almost useless. Toal gameplay is the best.

#### Persona 3 FES (PS2) / Persona 3 Portable (PSP)
A very theme driven game and successfully brings out the message of facing death and living in a compelling way. The OST though good is not my style. There are some glaring issues like imbalanced pacing, tedious dungeon climbing and questionable social links but still makes for a great experience. The four movies can be an acceptable way to experience the main plot as that is what makes this game shine.

#### Kingdom Hearts (PS2)
A simple Hero's Journey, but a great one. Unlike the later KH games, the main plot is tied nicely with the Disney worlds, making Sora's journey necessary and important to his character. One of the best execution for "Friendship is Power" trope. It can be cheesy but it is good because it is not baseless. Combat is simple and effective but the camera... did not age too well.

#### The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess (GC)
Actually a better Zelda game than WW in terms of complexity and combat. Midna is a great character and added a lot to the simple plot. Wolf Link is cool and TP Link is my favourite Link in the series.

#### Tales of Symphonia (PC)
The textbook RPG grand adventure. It contains every trope you have known and expect, yet manages to present itself with all the advantages of the tropes and stand out among others. I thought the plot twist although expected but still as shocking. The weak points being the combat and half of the cast not being relevant after their arcs.

#### Tales of the Abyss (PS2)
Great story, props to the scriptwriter for having the balls to write this kind of story. Luke's development is arguably one of the best in all of JRPGs. The other cast goes from decent to great (Anise can kindly fk off tho). The combat is a direct upgrade from Symphonia and is so so much better with the addition of Free Run. I loved the FoF mechanic. The pacing can be odd, way too many back and forth in between world maps. Guy is in the top 10 dudebros in JRPG history and no one can change my mind. Sadly its OST is all time low, only some important battle themes stand out, and the rest sounding too much like Symphonia or simply forgettable. Shoutouts to the anime, it is a fantastic adaptation and you should watch it.

#### Final Fantasy VII (PS1)
Decent story and characters. Having an event driven plot makes the characters feel a bit lacking. And the translation is indeed trash as it is almost impossible to understand the main plot correctly without explanations online. I highly recommend to emulate if you can accept the LEGO block models.

#### Terranigma (SNES)
Truly an ARPG ahead of its time. Great OST to create the mysterious and sombre atmosphere. Slightly dark/bittersweet ending is a nice touch. Surprisingly having some decent cast. Ark is simply a better Crono from Chrono Trigger. Technical limitations sometimes can hinder the combat system quite a bit.

#### Odin Sphere (PS2) 
A decent fairy tale with a somewhat elaborate world with a grander plot, multiple characters, everyone have arcs ranging from amazing to OK, decent OST. Combat can be clunky (at least the hit effects is dang satisfying) and alchemy can be a bit confusing. Also challenges resource management quite a bit due to very limited inventory. It features JP and English dub too, which is most rare in PS2 games.

#### Okami HD (PC) 
The Zelda game that is not named Zelda, feels a lot like Twilight Princess overall (wolf with a small sidekick and cleansing the world part). Running and jumping around as a cool wolf is fun. Beautiful Japanese artstyle. Brush gameplay is cool. Sadly the combat is just about the same as TP - too many tools made the fights too easy. The puzzles are really quite easy but can stuck in some places similar to Wind Waker, some parkours are pretty challenging IMO. The story is the simple save the world plot, but a lot goofier than I imagined. They really should have kept everything in one act instead of having multiple acts that shreds the hype. Boss reuse is pretty bad, not adding anything new even. Music is purely atmospheric. Derpy Ammy is pretty great.

### **INTERESTING titles**
*May not appeal to a lot of people, but still worth to check out*

#### Final Fantasy VIII (PC)
Plot: Mess, Characters (especially Squall and Rinoa): Beautiful, Gameplay: Mess, Music: Beautiful. Rated beautiful mess. Basically only Squall and Rinoa are the stars of this game. The important bits of other characters are either hidden in side quests or simply non existent. Seifer is such a wasted opportunity as a great rival to Squall. They could have done so much better with the story. Great OST, good use of motifs without making it repetitive like FFX. The gameplay... just nope. I used boosters in this game and did not regret a single bit.

#### Persona 2: Innocent Sin (PSP) 
Weird game. I am so glad PSP version is that easy i never fused a single persona (read: never engaged with battle system). Story is fine but sure can get weird very fast. Sadly I didn't like the music as much as I wanted to. Liked how no one is crafted as waifu/husbando or into specific tropes and equally reveals their lovable and hatable points.

It is waaaay too short for the price, could have use another dungeon or two, Casual is a bit too easy but who would expect normal RPG gamer mode to be named Expert. Nice combat system though can feel slow every battle. Nice little fairy tale but far weaker than Odin Sphere, half decent cast that has short stories tied into their quest but did not have any meaningful development in any way.

#### Tokyo Xanadu eX+ (PC)
I will always use this phrase to describe this game: *Budget Persona 4 - Made with Lots of Love*. Seeing what Falcom had achieved with Trails in the Sky I am even more confused why is this so mid. It contains every anime trope but does nothing interesting for the entire game. Some characters even looks like they are directly adapted from Persona 3/4, with the skin from Trails of Cold Steel. The main plot could have been fine but the True Ending had to ruin it. Somehow it managed to create another Kairi from KH, as if Kairi is not bad enough (no hate for Kairi here, she's pretty cute but nothing more than that). Combat is quite shallow and simple but is the best part about it, most mechanics are just "I Win Buttons (with too many X's)", at least there is dodge roll. Bosses ranges between too easy to too annoying. Only buy this on 80% discount.

Coming back from Ys VIII: Flash Roll in here is much more balanced and does not trivialize fights. X Drive is one of the better implementation of a "Limit Break" skill

Maybe I am not built for Mario games. The humour just fell flat on me and the story is already so simple as it is, there is not a lot to hook me in terms of story/characters. The music style just did not grab me, maybe is its instrumentation or composition i don't know, but it is not bad by all means. The battle theme really grew on me. The great thing is the combat which is the reason I completed this game. For dungeon design, there are a lot of sections relying on constant backtracking without the connectivity Zelda games offer and it can be mildly infuriating. And who the heck decided to add the realtime 30s minigame. I actually kind of enjoyed the Princess Peach sections, and this is where I realized Nintendo would have written princess characters for around 10 years when this game was released.

I am just glad the existence of this game inspired the great game that is Bug Fables (perhaps referenced TTYD a bit too much, such as most basic field/combat skills, RBGY items, tournament arc and many more). Other than the less puzzle filled dungeon design and a smaller world, BF improved and polished everything else compared to TTYD.

### **PRETTY nice but skippable**
*Not a waste of time, but nothing notable either*

#### Persona Q (3DS)
Meh Persona fanfic. All the characters you love become one dimensional and are used for "comedy" purpose. Has a decent original plot though. Etrian Odyssey gameplay is cool. Way too easy to exploit once you know it (Poison/Light+Dark skills).

#### Lunar: Silver Star Story (PSX)
A cult classic within the JRPG circle. But I think it really needs that nostalgia and era factor to become a great game. It feels like the FMA:B of JRPGs, but without that extra kick that makes it a real classic.

Story: The most standard RPG story I have experienced so far. It can be summed up as "Hero saves the Damsel in Distress with power of love and friendship", there are 0 big twist a modern gamer cannot see coming too. But do note that this story is written in 1992, I think what makes it stand out at the time is that its structure and presentation feels more like late 90s (dont quote me on this). Tons of animated cutscenes and voice acting adds a lot to the story. What it does great is tying its theme tightly to the main plot, although it can feel forced. For a love story, your main party consists of three (more like 2.5) couples with different dynamics and really make its point across clearly and strongly. 

Characters: The characters are pretty cliche but it should be spared for being an old game. Character development is decent and everyone have just enough of it. It would be nicer if Alex can show more personality because he showed quite some, even if it is typical protagonist personality. The banter between the party is the best part, adds a lot of life and quirkiness to them. 

Gameplay: Very standard, old school turn based system without anything notable. The inventory system is quite annoying. A lot more enjoyable on emulator to dodge encounters. No random encounter is great as usual. Surprising difficulty spike in the final dungeon? It did exactly different things compared to other RPG of the same age which are linear world maps, saving anywhere and giving lots of free heals, which I am sure is a big surprise to people played on release. 

Music: There are some bangers here and there. The battle theme is pretty catchy and addicting. The final boss not having a unique theme is a huge letdown. The main theme - Althena's Song is quite emotional too. But overall it is a OST just above average for me.

### **MEH**
*I just don't like these*

#### Kingdom Hearts 358/2 Days (DS) 
Played this for the story only cuz Roxas is my boy, Xion is eh. Definitely nailed the mundane life, if that is what the devs intended. Actually has a coherent story within which is the only good thing. Combat has some potential but largely wasted, definitely can be remade.

#### Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep (PSP)
PSP version is probably the worst way to experience this half of a train wreck. Aqua is the only saving grace out of this game.

#### I am Setsuna (PC)
No. You cannot just remake Lunar+Chrono Trigger without something fresh. They remade CT, but they left out the soul of CT and everything that makes it great. In the end it becomes a very bad attempt at imitating CT which is almost embarassing. Even taking away the comparison, it is still a below-average JRPG. It is still worth to know the context of OST that I have been listening since forever though. ** When a game is bad at what it does, you start noticing all the petty things.

Story/Plot: Mostly a rehash of FFX. The plot felt pretty empty and flat as there are no enough background to the "pilgrimage" unlike FFX with elaborate world building. It almost felt random. There are simply not enough to keep me to care about the main plot on an emotional level. They tried to present the theme of "sacrifice", but fails to present it in a meaningful way, in other words, amateurish. To be fair the concept is not bad and can definitely shine but it fell into the wrong hands. The ending is a mess, it just comes up at nowhere and reveals more plot points that's never referenced before and expects player to care. But luckily for how little there is, the main quest is really short, so players can end this snorefest quicker.

Characters: The cast almost collected all the weaknesses in different casts in various JRPGs and put them together. Lack of relevancy after own arc (and their arcs are as generic as it gets!), no memorable exchanges, one beat personality, you name it. It is like Lunar SSS, but the cast is now boring. I tried very hard but it is impossible to be attached to any of the characters. We have: the silent protagonist that gets no interesting options and just there for plot reasons, Setsuna a.k.a Mary Sue, the plot dumper, the annoying kid, and a bunch of others. And I am sure the devs did not realize that looking like Auron does not automatically makes him cool like Auron.

Gameplay: I get the devs wanted to create the authentic 90s experience, but you cannot just ignore some modern QoL like auto text scroll/cutscene skip (unless the dialogue is as good as Bug Fables/Trails) and faster walking speed. Momentum system is a decent twist to the CT base system. The skill and equipment system can be a bit more streamlined. The controls are sometimes unresponsive while moving.

Music: One of my favourite OSTs of all time and listened to it religiously even before this playthrough. It fits the game's environment and vibe perfectly. Also perfect for listening on its own. But the engineering is not good. Some inappropriate usages and no looping/continuation at certain scenes really kills the mood. They did not fully exploit the potential in this OST when it could improve the auditory experience a lot more than this. There are also some questionable SFX choices that just ruin the song eg travelling with airship.

#### Illusion of Gaia (SNES)
Quintet RPG is an acquired taste. Gameplay feels more Zelda than RPG, with traditional puzzles that are annoying and challenging in a fun way. It has the same vibe/weirdness as Terranigma. The plot is less structured than Terranigma, sometimes leaves me wondering why I am still playing it. The music is far not as magical as Terranigma for sure.

#### Legend of Mana (PS1)
It pains me to put this game here because I loved the art and music, but the gameplay and non linear story just puts me off so much. The story is more like an anthology than a coherent plot and you play as an observer (knowing this fact beforehand makes everything so much better). Quite a unique experience despite everything. The combat is way too unbearable, moving around and hitting things is a pain in itself. I don't know why the overworld movement cannot be used in combat instead of sliding left and right.  I just have to accept this game is not for me and move on.

This is Yoko Shimomura's single best standalone OST. It captured the magical fantasy world like no other, not even her future self achieved this kind of raw sense of imagination. I will die on this hill.

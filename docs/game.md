## Video Games Collection

I only got in touch with video games in my late teens so I didn't get to play too much of them. Moreover life is getting in my way slowly but surely.

### ALL TIME favourites
The games that changed my gaming view (ruin other games) in one way or another

**Kingdom Hearts 2 Final Mix (PS2)**
This game serves as my first experience to speedrunning. I found [Bl00dyBizkit's AGDQ2017 run](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVjf3bc3Noo&t=4588s) when looking for Roxas strats and the rest is history, and this is still my favourite speedrun. I play the randomizer a lot and learnt some speedrun strats.

| Story/Plot    | Characters    | Gameplay  | Music        |
| ------------- | ------------- | --------- | ------------ |
| C      | D | S+ | S |

**Persona 4 (PS2/Golden PC)**
(Immediately started NG+ right after NG, almost 100% except fighting Margaret, learnt speedrun routes)
- Final Fantasy X (Absolutely love the characters, the world and the plot. But I suck at this game.)
- The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker (Semi proficient rando player)
- Tales of Berseria (Completed most sidequests and I am normally a no-sidequest player, still has bad dungeons and less memorable OST tho)
- Bug Fables: The Everlasting Sapling (great cast, very good OST)
- Trails in the Sky FC+SC (Elaborate world building, great cast chemistry. natural character growth, banger OST, good combat system, pretty much perfect, Estelle is Bestelle, maybe the best localization ever existed in video games)
